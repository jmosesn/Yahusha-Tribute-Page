        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Yahusha Hamashiach lived in 1st-Century Palestine/Canaan/Israel during the time Israel was under Roman Empire rule.
          The Israelites were conquered and scattered into various nations, due to their wickedness towards Yahuah. Yahusha began His ministry at
          30yrs old, preaching the gospel of the kingdom. He preached to Israel to repent, for the kingdom of Yah is near.
          He is often misrepresented as being only gentle and loving. Yahusha was a real man who always kept it real.
          He preached the goodnews to gather the lost sheep who had been scattered. He was a revolutionary. Not only was he a revolutionary
          leader & teacher amongst Israel, He was a perfect man. The Lamb of Yah who was without blemish, the Passover Lamb. He was persecuted off of false charges,
          led by the pharisees. He was severly torchered, beaten beyond recognition, nailed and hung on a tree. His death &
          ressurection brought salvation to Israel and to the world, to those who cling unto Him.
          He is the way, the truth, and the life. Let us all give honor and thanks to The Lion of Judah, the High Priest/King, our Lord & Savior. All Praise to the Most High Yah through His Son Yahusha Hamashiach!
